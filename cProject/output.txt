Peptone’s success stems from more than 30 years of academic expertise combined with an international team of physicists, biologists, engineers, biophysicists, HPC experts and mathematicians, all bound by the passion for physics and pharmacology.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe relationship between Peptone and Studiogusto has shown, right from the beginning, exceptional chemistry, that led the British company to choose the artisanal boutique of digital experiences to develop its own communication project. \"To be chosen by specialists in Mathematical calculations of the best possible solution says it all, it’s already an honour as it is\" said Stefano Caliandro, Creative Director and Co-founder of Studiogusto. \"Having the chance to know and work with Peptone is highly stimulating from an intellectual perspective. Their philosophy is to verify and hypothesise the routes that may lead to scientific failure and, even if we come from two different worlds, it’s not so different from our way of communicating. When we develop projects and produce content, we think fast and try to verify and avoid possible misinterpretations, mimicking the way of thinking and seeing of those who will live the experience we produce. Thanks to this remote relationship, we are able to choose the right route and overcome the barrier between sender and recipient.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePer aspera ad astra, the latin proverb, which can be translated as \"through hardships to the stars\", has gradually become a small inspirational mantra for Studiogusto’s project development: it not only represents Peptone’s approach, reaching drug design goals while mitigating risks, but also serves as a guidance for those daring times of a global pandemic, which test our focus, resilience and humility.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"Visual storytelling is a powerful yet much underappreciated tool in the domain of science-driven companies. Communicating complex and often abstract concepts is a non-trivial task\", said Dr. Kamil Tamiola, Peptone’s CEO. “Since the very first days of Peptone we have known that communicating our mission and value proposition will require vast investments of time and this is why we have decided to hand over this mission to true professionals; Studiogusto. We are incredibly excited about Studiogusto's technological prowess and near-obsessive attention to details. Moreover, we do find Studiogusto's creative approach to science-driven storytelling a true breeze of fresh air in the world of mundane corporate messaging.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStudiogusto's creative team designed a unique experience that is at the verge of the digital representation of proteins and an immersive world of surreal art.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"We created a modern visual which resonates with contemporary and professional audiences, especially with individuals sensitive to details, interaction and design, but absolutely demanding when it comes to content and opportunities to learn more\" says Caliandro. \"We created a captivating outfit for a corporate container which, depending on the work dynamics, transforms into a professional tool which is able to convert the generated leads.\"\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe collaboration between Studiogusto and Peptone will pave a way for a completely novel breed of interactive experiences for deep-tech focused companies that shift the boundaries of applicable science.\u003c/p\u003e","publishedAt":"2022-08-02T09:48:17.548Z","color":"#A893FF"},{"id":6,"slug":"a-journey-of-two-the-power-of-co-branding-for-indel-b-and-fiamma","title":"A journey of two: the power of co-branding for Indel B and Fiamma","description":"\u003cp\u003eThinking creatively does not only mean to find a unique, distant and never travelled before road for everyone. It also means to see what parts of the journey would bring the best feeling if walked down together with someone else. — Bonds, more than collaborations, are still things very looked down on when talking about businesses within the same or adjacent markets, — says Leonardo Tironzelli, Art Director of Studiogusto. — Brands are often afraid to be outshined, or that they can dim each other’s light if working together, and above all that they would invest into something that brings advantage just to someone else. Of course when collaborating everything as to reach the perfect balance, but for those who have the courage to take the big step and share part of the journey, co-branding is really something that opens the doors to new possibilities. That is why we are so happy with work we made together with Indel B and Fiamma. —\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe collaboration Leonardo Tironzelli hints at is a very special one: Indel B and Fiamma are two iconic Italian brands creating equipment dedicated to exalt van life and outdoor experience. Indel B offers systems and solutions for mobile refrigeration and air conditioning to the most important international players, with a history of innovation that brought the brand up in space when NASA chose Indel B custom refrigerator to be installed on the shuttle Columbia, in 1982.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFiamma is known worldwide as a pioneer and leading company in manufacturing technical accessories for the recreational vehicle market, with more than 100 patents registered in Europe, USA, Japan, and China.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStudiogusto thought to combine the needs both the clients shared in terms of media assets for their adv campaigns, developing synergistic productions that would include their products at the same time. — The work with Studiogusto and Indel B has been neat and seamless — affirms Giovanna Colombo, Marketing \u0026amp; Communication Manager of Fiamma. — Co-branding means above all finding the right balance on multiple marketing-related factors, from the ways the products are shown to their combinations in the different sets. The result achieved an idea and ideal of lifestyle, comfort, complete and unique outdoor experience that is exactly what Fiamma is about. —\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe benefits of creating ambitious, high-quality co-branding productions like this are many: the sources and costs are optimized, the team working on the project is wider, and the photo and video shoot sets become more and more authentic due to the presence of the two product ranges. Also, it is a strategy than can bring to the formation of a stronger and more consistent international network. — Experiencing this journey alongside Fiamma has really been captivating — says Daniele Riccioni, Head of Marketing of Indel B. — When everything says that alone is better, it really takes to be bold to decide to share something as important as adv campaigns are nowadays. Today’s businesses grew afraid of bonds, but the one with Fiamma proved that companies need to reach a more collective dimension, not only in terms of marketing, but also for the social and environmental impact. This could be key to a better future. We want to thank Studiogusto for making this bond happen and for having turned into a beautiful campaign we are very happy to see as the start of something new. —\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStudiogusto will continue to promote this business bonding among its clients, to build positive synergies together. The journey of a company is really a life-like experience, with alone moments to reflect and grow, and times when being together makes everyone reach their peak.\u003c/p\u003e","publishedAt":"2022-09-13T09:40:37.920Z","color":"#99B874"}],"seo":{"id":2,"seo_title":"Studiogusto - A Culture–First Creative Agency - Italy / Germany","seo_description":"Gusto IDS aka Studiogusto is an international creative agency.
